# MovieRecommdationSys
The movie recommender system is implemented using Python and utilizes content-based filtering and cosine similarity. The system processes a dataset of movies, extracting relevant features like genres, keywords, taglines, cast, director, and overview. 
Text data is converted into numerical values using TF-IDF vectorization. 
Cosine similarity is then computed between movies based on these feature vectors.
